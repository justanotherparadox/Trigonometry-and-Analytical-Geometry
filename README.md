# Trigonometry-and-Analytical-Geometry
Visualization is important !

Trigonometry:

1. A treatise on plane trigonometry by Ernst William Hobson is highly recommended for first approach. It's a comprehensive text and
   covers almost all of the fundamental concepts.
   
2. Next we will approach tougher topics.

I will be adding some practice material and links to study other concepts.


Analytical Geometry:

I will be providing my hand written notes and other materials which will be for a first course.

Hilton's Plane Algebraic Curves----> It is one of the best texts out there and is one of a kind but certainly not for a first course.
